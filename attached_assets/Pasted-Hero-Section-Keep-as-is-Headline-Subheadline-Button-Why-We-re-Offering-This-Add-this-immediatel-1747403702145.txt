Move Your Guarantee to Prime Real Estate
Place it immediately after the "Why" section
Make it visually distinctive (different background color, border)
Add a trust-building icon (shield, checkmark, etc.)
Add Visual Credibility Elements
Customer logos if you have recognizable clients
Industry association badges
"As featured in" media mentions if applicable
Improve Button Visibility and Frequency
Ensure call-to-action buttons appear after every major section
Use contrasting colors that stand out
Add urgency language to buttons ("Secure Your Spot Before They're Gone")
The most critical change is moving your guarantee up substantially. In Hormozi's framework, reducing perceived risk is one of the most powerful conversion elements. Highlighting your guarantee early answers the prospects' biggest question: "What if this doesn't work?" before it becomes an objection.
